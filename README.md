# C_Projects
This repository is a collection of my C++ projects, mainly from my CSC376 class at University of Illinois at Springfield.

Some of these projects included a focus on using bit fields to manage memory allocation.  Other projects deal more with

the computation behind converting decimal numbers to another base.
